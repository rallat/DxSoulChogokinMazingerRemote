# DxSoulChogokinMazingerRemote
# Goal
My [remote](http://www.collectiondx.com/gallery/v/Toys/Bandai/SOC/DXMaz/PC210735.jpg.html) is broken and only the three buttons at the bottom work.
The goal was to read the IR codes that worked and trying to find the pattern for the other three and hopefully build another remote ;)

# Setup
This is the hardware setup that works with the code in this repo. I followed the tutorial in [sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/ir-control-kit-hookup-guide)
